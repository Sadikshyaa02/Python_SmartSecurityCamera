## Introduction
This project was completed as Part of Year Three of BSC Software Engineering at the University of Northampton.

It was part of the module CSY3010 - Media Technology and was an assessment on a range of topics related to multimedia technologies. Including the fundamentals of image and video followed by some advanced topics on multimedia systems and content distribution networks.

This assessment piece took a live video feed and allows a user to run it through a motion detection system. If there is any motion, a bounding box is drawn around the movement.
Computer vision techniques through the Open CV library identify the object and create a text log. 
Anytime movement is detected the frame is also saved. This allows later reviews of the footage to identify intruders.

## Brief (Simplified)
You are providing a security solution to a large warehouse in Northampton. Due to the size of the warehouse complex, it is not practical to have security staff patrolling the site 24/7. You propose a smart security camera system that can detect unauthorized access using video camera feed and computer vision techniques. The solution must be Python-based.

Minimum specification:
•	Import video content
•	Detect motions in the video that are associated with unauthorized access.
•	Save the video segments that capture the detected motion with annotated information to help humans review the incidents.

Additional features may include but are not limited to:
•	Live video feed.
•	Categorise different movements e.g., human, vehicle, etc.
•	Detecting and tracking moving objects.
•	Multiple camera feed coordination for enhanced motion detection.
•	Image and video compression for improved online access.
•	Image processing for camera distortion.
•	Image/video stitching
•	Interactive user interface
